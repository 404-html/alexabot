Discord bot that only plays Despacito


### You need to add a config.json file with the following:

```
{  
     "token"  : "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

### You need a few modules, in this order

```
npm install discord.js node-opus yt-search
```
If you're on Windows:
```
npm install --vs2015 -g windows-build-tools
```
If you're on Linux:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
Then install Python 2.7 - it MUST be 2.7
```
Next:
```
npm install node-gyp better-sqlite3
```
